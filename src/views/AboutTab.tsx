        My career (and life) has been pretty darn fun up to this point!
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked at a few startups, a few bigger companies, and even started
        a company or three of my own. My most defining roles have been the ones
        where I can learn very quickly with a high level of autonomy, and with a
        team of very smart, creative, and diverse people.

        The reason I became an engineer was because I needed a CRM & ERP (fancy
        terms for software that tracks sales and materials) for my chocolate
        company. We were producing hundreds of pounds of chocolate per day and
        shipping to REI, Nordstrom, and Whole Foods locations across the
        country. I tried a bunch of out-of-the-box solutions (even got in a
        legal spat trying to get out of one of those "solutions") and none of
        them worked quite right. So I decided to build my own. In doing so, I
        discovered relational databases. To say that changed my life is a bit of
        an understatement.
      </p>
      <p>
        I left my chocolate company to learn how to code and I have been doing
        that ever since. I've worked on a lot of different projects, but the
        ones that I am most proud of are the ones that have a direct impact on
        people's lives. I've built software that helps dairy farmers track their
        cows' diets, apps that help small businesses automate their bookkeeping
        with AI, and systems that help multinational organizations protect their
        datastores from bad actors.
      </p>

        The thing that makes me most unique as a developer is the fact that I
        have sat at three different seats at the proverbial table: I've been a
        CEO of growing companies. I've been a digital designer. And I've been a
        dev. My less than linear path has given me the tools to understand
        problems and communicate answers in ways that most people can't.

        I live in Bend, Oregon with my wife, Tess, and our dog Mark. We love to
        hike, cook, and travel together. We moved to Bend in 2022 to get closer
        to the mountains and the sun. And boy oh boy has this place delivered!
